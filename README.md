# AP Computer Science Principles Create Performance Task - connect3 (Perfect Score)
The program's purpose is to play Connect 3 against the user. Connect 3 is a game similar to Connect 4, in which 2 players alternate placing tokens of their color in columns, and those tokens fall down to the lowest empty space in the column they're placed in. Connect 3 is played on a 4x4 board and the first player to get 3 tokens of their color in a row wins.

The program is implemented using dynamic programming and memoization to optimize runtime.
